Binary Tree Preorder Traversal Total Accepted: 1092 Total Submissions: 3234 My Submissions
Given a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

For example:
Given binary tree {1,#,2,3},
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3
return [1,2,3].

Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
